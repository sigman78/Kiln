# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. The format is based on

Pre-1.0: API breaks are allowed but every break is recorded here with migration notes.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- KTX2 real-world corpus (`tests/corpus/ktx2/`): curated Khronos KTX-Software test images (Apache-2.0) plus `ktx create`-generated variants, a manifest-driven reader test, writer round-trips with DFD byte comparison, and `ktx validate` CTest checks on every file kiln writes (CI installs KTX-Software 4.4.2). Format table gains RGB8, ETC2/EAC and ASTC LDR rows.
- M1.5: read-only shipping contract: cook headers moved to include/kiln/cook/, install components (runtime, cook), *-shipping presets, shipping CI job with a find_package consumer, reader-only test split.
- M1: `.mesh` reader (`kiln/mesh.h`: spec v0.3 records, `MeshView`, always-on header/BLOB checks, full validation, payload decode loop with codec None, checksum and index checks) and deterministic writer (`kiln/cook/mesh_writer.h`, kiln_cook); KTX2 raw reader (`kiln/ktx2.h`) and writer (`kiln/cook/ktx2_writer.h`); `Format` enum + constexpr table (`kiln/formats.h`, values == VkFormat); `kiln-info` tool; `docs/diagnostics.md` (K4000-K4199).
- Project display name is Kiln; GitHub repository renamed to sigman78/Kiln (namespace, CMake package and targets stay lowercase `kiln`).

### Fixed
- KTX2 writer: the alpha sample of sRGB formats carried the EXPONENT qualifier (0x20) instead of LINEAR (0x10); found by `ktx validate`.

### Changed
- Header paths: kiln/mesh_writer.h -> kiln/cook/mesh_writer.h, kiln/ktx2_writer.h -> kiln/cook/ktx2_writer.h (pre-1.0 break; update includes).

- M0: repository skeleton, CMake targets and presets, CI, core vocabulary types (allocator,
  Result/Status, panic, log, Span/StrView, FixedArray/Vec/HashMap, hash/fourcc), minimal test
  runner, design notes.
- Design notes aligned to HANDOFF v2 (blob table, MetaReady, kind placeholders, load groups,
  publish/acquire/caps, gpu()).
- mesh-format-spec v0.3: KMSH magic, kiln::mesh namespace, exact-minor version rule while 0.x, BLOB rules resolved (filter/codec combinations, split alignment, table order, raw fast path conditions, lodRank, size limits).
